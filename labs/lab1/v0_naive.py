"""Lab 1, Part A — the version everyone writes first.

Run it. Do not fix it. Characterise how it fails.

    python labs/lab1/v0_naive.py --n 40

This file is intentionally bad in ways that are intentionally realistic. Every
one of its problems has been shipped to production by someone with a job title
more senior than yours.

Read the output carefully. It is in two halves, and the second half is the
interesting one: a *single* trivial bug in `extract_v0` hides every other
defect in the model's output behind it. You cannot count what you cannot parse.
